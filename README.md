## How To
### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) >= v20.10
- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html#install-sam-cli-instructions) >= 1.96.0

### Clone the repo
```shell
git clone git@github.com:govuk-one-login/account-interventions-service.git
cd account-interventions-service
```

### Setup Pre-Commit
```shell
$ pre-commit install -f
```

### Install Project Dependencies
``` bash
$ yarn install
```

### Build & Test Project
To fully test the application, try the test command below
``` bash
$ yarn build

$ yarn lint
```
- `yarn lint:code` - TypeScript is linted by [ESLint](.eslintrc.js)
- `yarn lint:iac` - SAM template is linted by [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/validate-cfn-lint.html)
- `yarn lint:spec:oas` - OpenAPI specification is linted by [Spectral](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/validate-cfn-lint.html)

#### Fix ES Lint Issues
```shell
$ yarn lint:code:fix
```

### Check For Vulnerable Dependencies
```shell
$ yarn audit
```
#### Fix Vulnerable Dependencies

## Additional Info


### Old SAM version
If you already have an earlier version of SAM installed you may need to either upgrade SAM or uninstall it
and reinstall it.
Here are some instructions you can follow to do this:
```shell
$ brew upgrade aws-sam-cli
```
[Managing AWS SAM CLI versions - AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/manage-sam-cli-versions.html)

### Pre-commit

The command may be required if you do not already have pre-commit installed on your machine
```shell
$ brew install pre-commit
```

### Using nodenv
If you work across multiple Node.js projects there's a good chance they require different Node.js and npm versions.

To enable this we use [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#readme) to switch between versions automatically.

1. Install and setup [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#installation).
2. Install the NodeJS version used by this project `nodenv install <node-version>`.

```shell
$ brew install nodenv
$ nodenv init
$ cat .node-version | nodenv install
```

Getting latest releases of Node Version supported by nodenv (this may take a while)
```shell
brew upgrade nodenv node-build
```

### Webpack process
Webpack is configured to scan the SAM template file [template.yaml](./src/infra/main/template.yaml) looking for lambda function
declarations in order to find the handler files, i.e. the webpack entry files, to perform bundling on.

1. Looks for resource where `Type` = `AWS::Serverless::Function`).
2. Uses the function resource's `CodeUri` value as the folder where it will output the function's webpack'd code.
3. Uses the function resource's `Handler` value as the file to use as a webpack entry.
4. Per web pack entry, finds the function's handler file in the `src/handlers` folder.
5. Runs the webpack process and writes the bundle in to the `dist` folder in the locations expected by the SAM template.
