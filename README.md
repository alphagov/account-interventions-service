### Using nvm (optional)
If you work across multiple Node.js projects there's a good chance they require different Node.js and npm versions.

To enable this we use [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to switch between versions easily.

1. [install nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)
2. Run `nvm install` in the project directory (this will use [.nvmrc](/../../.nvmrc))
3. Follow the steps above to install and start
